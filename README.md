## Program 8 - Text
This program works with two different fonts to create two different bodies of text. One body scrolls through the top of the screen while the other makes a paragraph block that fills the rest of the screen. the theme is a motivational poster, so the text provides uplifting statements along with a chalkboard theme with a green background and doodle themed text

## Program 10 - 3D
The final project creates three 3D objects along with dynamic, point, and directional lighting. 2 objects are a simple sphere and cube. the cube rotates along the y axis. directional and point lighting is controlled by the user's mouse input. the color of the light is ultimately random. the final 3d object is a cube with a texture on it. the cube can also rotate in any direction depending on the user's mouse input.
